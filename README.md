# WatchWise

An open source application that`s based on MVVM clean architecture pattern and jetpack compose, it uses thetvdb.com Rest Api in order to fetch top rated and popular movies

It uses Room database to store movies for watch later list.

Uses dagger hilt for dependency injection.

Uses Retrofit as a Rest client.

I did my best in documenting the entire app without polluting it's files.

When you first open the app it shows a view pager with two pages that are Top-Rated and Popular movies and the 2 GridViews load more data as you scroll.

If you clicked any movie you will be navigated to the movie details screen that has breif details about that movies and a button to add it to or remove it from watch later.

You can access the watch later screen from the top right icon in the main screen, and you can exit the app by backpressing the main screen.
